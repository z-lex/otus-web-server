# OTUServer

Sample asynchronous web server. 

# How to use
To start the server, use the following command:
```shell
$ python httpd.py [-w NUMBER_OF_WORKERS] [-r DOCUMENT_ROOT]
```
If ``NUMBER_OF_WORKERS`` is not specified, two worker processes will be created; if ``DOCUMENT_ROOT`` is omitted - the 
current directory will be used as the document root.

Port 8080 must not be used by any other process. To check that the server is running, enter ``http://localhost:8080/``
in browser. Contents of the ``DOCUMENT_ROOT/index.html`` or the empty page should be displayed.

# Features
* Delivery of static content only
* Processing ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests only
* Ability to run multiple worker processes with an asynchronous loop in each of them
* Processing percent-encoded urls

# Requirements
* Python â‰¥ 3.6 is required
* Server uses ``epoll()`` system call supported only on Linux 2.5.44 and newer

# Stress testing
Stress testing is performed using the ``ab`` utility. In Ubuntu it is available as a part of the ``apache2-utils`` 
package:
```shell
$ sudo apt install apache2-utils
```

To start testing, use the following command:
```shell
$ ab -n 50000 -c 100 http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

Sample output:
```log
